# Arcade Performance Tests

Various performance tests for arcade.
We are in many cases comparing the performance with pygame.

## Installing requirements

Preferably in a virtual environment:

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running Tests

Run ``src/__main__.py`` which should:

* Run all tests
* Generate all graphs
* Generate all documents

## Step 3

Look at the resulting documents in ``doc/build``
